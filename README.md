# Digital-Library-Management-System
I have created a Digital Library Management System using PHP and MySQL Workbench. In this system, books are uploaded as PDF files by the admin, and students can download these PDFs. Additionally, students can send a request to the librarian to issue a book, with a maximum of two book requests allowed at a time.
